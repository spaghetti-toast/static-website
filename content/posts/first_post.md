I don't have a whole lot to say in this first post, except that I'm glad that I got this to work, and that you are now bearing witness to the fruits of my hard work ~~copying and pasting from documentation~~.

I suppose I can warn you on some things to expect from my endless dribble:
- Thoughts on things that I may find interesting over time,
- Reflections on previous thoughts of things that I found interesting,
- Write ups from my cybersecurity endeavours,
- Records of my proudest achievements, and even
- Yappin' of the obnoxious variety (opinion pieces),

If you like RSS, tags will be included for my posts. I am planning to sort into categories based on the above. 

While I'm no journalist, I think I may have a few intersting things to write about. To which you, intrepid reader, will hopefully enjoy reading.
